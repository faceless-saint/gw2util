A simple launch utility for Guild Wars 2

## Features
* Easily manage multiple accounts on one machine

* Shortcuts to commonly used CLI arguments

This tool is primarily written with my own uses in mind, and so it may
not fit perfectly with your use case, but PRs and feature requests are
still welcome!
